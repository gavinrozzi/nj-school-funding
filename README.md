# NJ School Funding Formula Analysis

 NJ School funding formula code and analysis. This algorithm was required to be released in response to litigation from the Brick Township Board of Education's OPRA litigation.
 
 The original code is written in SAS and was provided in PDF form. I extracted the code from the PDF to plain text and exported it to a plain text .sas file contained within this repository.

 I am also working on creating an R implementation of the algorithm due to the limitations & cost of working with SAS.

 Data used in this analysis was obtained from the New Jersey Department of Education and is contained in the /data folder. A table of equalized valuations for 2020 was obtained from the New Jersey Division of Taxation.

 This is a work in progress.
